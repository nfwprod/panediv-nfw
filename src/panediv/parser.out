Parsing method: LALR

state 0

    (0) S' -> . command
    (1) command -> . COMMAND_SIMPLE
    (2) command -> . COMMAND_SQ
    (3) command -> . COMMAND_DQ

    COMMAND_SIMPLE  shift and go to state 2
    COMMAND_SQ      shift and go to state 3
    COMMAND_DQ      shift and go to state 4

    command                        shift and go to state 1

state 1

    (0) S' -> command .



state 2

    (1) command -> COMMAND_SIMPLE .

    $end            reduce using rule 1 (command -> COMMAND_SIMPLE .)


state 3

    (2) command -> COMMAND_SQ .

    $end            reduce using rule 2 (command -> COMMAND_SQ .)


state 4

    (3) command -> COMMAND_DQ .

    $end            reduce using rule 3 (command -> COMMAND_DQ .)
